## Contributing

This project really needs help to finish the last pages and also in the future when the GNOME desktop changes. Any help is welcome!


However for new contributors please follow those rules:

- do not over complicate things
- stick to the service, viewmodel, view approach
- as long as we stick to the provider package try to avoid context.watch as much as possible and always prefer context.select
- as long as we stick to the provider package try to avoid provider calls as much as possible and prefer to forward callbacks and values where you can
- do not split files with [the part keyword](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/create-packages#organizing-a-package)
- do not shadow function definitions with [typedef](https://dart.dev/language/typedefs)
- use absolute imports
